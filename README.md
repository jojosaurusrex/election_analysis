# election_analysis

## Project Overview
Using python within Visual Studio Code find:
1) Total votes cast
2) A complete list of all candidates who recived votes
3) Total number of votes each candidate recived
4) Percentages of votes recived by each candidate
5) The winner of the election based off the popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.2, Visual Studio Code 1.64.2

## Challenge Overview
The continuous use of python within Visual Studio Code allowed me to put my newly developed skills to the test. The challenge requested the following information to be printed in the terminal as well as in the election_anlaysis.txt:
1) Total votes cast in the election
2) Each candidate's total votes and respective percentages of the total votes
3) Winner of the election and their total votes and percentage 
4) Each county's total votes and their respective percentages of the total votes
5) County with the largest number of voters

## Challenge Results
The election analysis challenge shows:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast.
- The participating counties were:
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe
- The election results via each particpating county:
  - Jefferson cast 10.5% of all votes with 38,855 votes.
  - Denver cast 82.8% of all votes with 306,055 votes.
  - Arapahoe cast 6.7% of all votes with 24,801 votes
- The largest particpating county was:
  -  Denver with an outstanding 82.8% of all votes with 306,055 votes.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The election results for each candidate were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of all votes with 85,213 votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of all votes with 272,892 votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of all votes with 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of all votes with 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Summary
If there is ever a need to use this analysis again, refer to the step by step instructions below:
  1) Download this repository
  2) Save the new results of the election as 'election_results.csv" and overwrite the past election results.
  3) Run the code. 
  4) If there are any problems either change the directory at the top or contact me to do it for you.

One way to modify this script, is to change how I set up the initial directory. It could have been done exactly like the module and would have probably made my life a bit easier. Another way to analyze this code and get more granular would be to include the demographic of the people who voted for each candidate to see of there are any trends; however, this comes with a request for more data rather than a way to modify my script.
